abstract: >
    This report presents the development of a tool to launch network attacks using the Scapy library,
    to demonstrate the use of Scapy to perform different network attacks, in particular Wifi deauthentication,
    ARP cache poisoning and DHCP Starvation attacks.
    Are described the usage of the library and its main features, the implementation of the tool and the
    attacks, and the results of the tests performed.

# Introduction

Imagine this: It's a typical Tuesday morning. You're sipping your coffee, checking your emails, and planning your day. Suddenly, your internet connection drops.
You try to reconnect, but it's no use.
You call your service provider,
only to find out that your router has been the victim of a Wifi deauthentication attack with the goal of stealing your access point credentials.
Your entire day is disrupted, all because of a vulnerability in your network.

This is not a hypothetical scenario, but a real-life situation that could happen to anyone, anywhere.
Our report delves into the Scapy library, a tool that can launch such attacks, not to create fear, but to educate and empower.
By understanding these threats, we can build stronger defenses and ensure that our digital world remains secure.

In order to be able to protect from these vulnerabilities, we need to understand how they work, including how they are implemented.
Thanks to its intuitive interface and its powerful features, Scapy represents a great tool to demonstrate these attacks.

Scapy is a Python framework which allows to craft, decode, send and capture network packets.
